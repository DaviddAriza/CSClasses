The project uses the in program functions setup, draw, and keyPressed. The setup function first loads the image, resizes it to the window display, and creates a duplicate to act as an image buffer. The draw function displays the image on to the background of the window. The keyPressed function serves as the keyboard input for the various functions in the the program where the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 correspond to the filters grayscale, contrast, gaussian 3x3 blur, edge detection, and gaussian 5x5 blur respectively, and the integer 0 corresponds to resetting the image to it's original look. For each of the filters, there is a respective unique function that has the necessary code to take the original image and apply the filter over it. In the grayscaleFilter function, the images pixels are looped though and the color values for the red, green, and blue channels get averaged to gray out the image. In the contrast filter, the images pixels get looped through as well and based on the set threshold and contrast values entered, the values for the red, green, and blue color channels gets contrasted with respect to those values. In the gaussian 3x3 and 5x5 blur filter functions, the function duplicates the image, checks to see if the kernel adds up to 1, loops through the pixels in the images, constrains the gaussian blur for the edge pixels to prevent a black edge, blurs the image with respect to it's corresponding gaussian kernel, and outputs the new image. For the edgeDetectionFilter, the program takes in the horizontal and vertical Sobel operators as kernels, duplicates the image, loops through the pixels in the image and applies both Sobel operators onto each pixel, takes the magnitude of the resulting operation with respect to the red, green, and blue color channels, and constrains the resulting values for each pixel. Lastly the resetImage function resets the image back to it's original look. Also there should be no issues in the program.
