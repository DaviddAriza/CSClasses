Introduction
Red
wine
has
become
a
large
part
of
todayâ€™s
society,
being
used
as
housewarming
gifts
or

a
way

during
the
weekend.
Red
wine
is
known
for
its
rich
flavors
which
many
people
have
come
to
enjoy.
This
wine
can
range
from
cheap
bottles
for
consumption
all
the
way
to
incredibly
expensive
gifts
depending
on
the
aging
process
or
the
ingredients
used
to
make
the
wine.
Because
of
this
wine
is
very
popular
making
the
global
wine-making
industry
make
29
billion
dollars
a
year.
Red
wine
is
primarily
made
up
of
red
grapes
that
have
been
crushed
for
their
juice,
fermented
with
yeast,
and
then
aged
for
long
periods
of
time.
The
yeast
reacts
with
the
sugars
of
the
grapes
to
form
carbon
dioxide
and
ethanol
which
gives
the
wine
its
alcoholic
properties.1
Depending
on
how
long
a
winemaker
lets
a
wine
age
and
what
it
is
aged
in,
it
can
change
the
flavor
of
the
wine
allowing
thousands
of
different
varieties
of
red
wines
to
exist.
