David Ariza: My strengths are that I am a good communicator and I can adapt to situations quickly. My weaknesses are that it takes some time to do the assignment because I am occupied with other classes, work, and extracurriculars that take up my time. For the project, I worked on the frequency visualization by writing code in processing to create a pie chart that displays the frequencies of the words in the text.

I haven't noticed any weaknesses with Cole and is a reliable teammate.

I haven't noticed any weaknesses with Liyan and is also a reliable teammate. For the project, Liyan worked on the cloud word visualization by writing code in processing to create a colored word cloud that covers the entire window using the unique words text file.
